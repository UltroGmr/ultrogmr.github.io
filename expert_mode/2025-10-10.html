time

this is a 163 bpm, breakcore? (closest thing to it) track. for breakcore, it's actually on the slower end!
the only reason i'd consider it breakcore is because that genre seems to be heavily based on the "amen break" drum loop samples, so is this song. but i didn't go crazy with it, which most breakcore does seem to do
to me, the song has a nostalgic or mystical feel. where did all the time go? specifically - the quieter piano part at around 0:53. this is probably due to the fact that, despite the part being written in minor, almost all of the chords in there are actually major! (E D F# Bm; E D C#aug F#) notice the usage of the Picardy third, aka ending a minor composition with a major tonic chord, which i didn't know about when i wrote that... but coincidentally found out about a couple days afterward
this was also made at the exact point where i transitioned to the composition style i then used for isolation and Space Boss.
i tend to really bounce between compositional styles. the change in style usually happens when a "creative drought" ends, which is where: oh no, i suddenly lost my ability to compose and now i'm sad! but during those times, i still get to look forward to the inevitable bounce back where i suddenly get way better at writing music


isolation

the chord progression, and first retro-sounding part were actually written on 2025 08 25! fun fact - during that first chord progression, there is a shift from D minor to D major.... which was completely accidental! i forgot i was actually in D minor. but it really brings the whole thing up, so i think it was a very lucky mistake for me to have made
then a month or so later, i got the idea to continue it with that piano melody over the same chords (which in my opinion, i did a really good job on). then, i one-upped myself and made an EVEN BETTER melody + chord progression employing my technique to modulate by a minor third (use the vii°-I resolution, but substitute the vii° for the vii° of a key one minor third away, and resolve in that new key). i wonder if that's really what's making it sound good, or if it's simply that minor third modulations sound awesome

i think what happened is that. because i got stuck with the basics for so long. i got really, insanely good with the basics, elementary stuff. beepbox. scratch. etc

then, when the basics ultimately limited me, circa 8th grade ('24) eventually i'd have to make a jump to the real deal. the (still ongoing) transition from Beepbox to FL has been rough, and i've had to make occasional returns to Beepbox. (which usually produces <a href="../../music/2024-11-10.mp3">great results</a>!) i do think i was lucky to get to learn the basic programs somewhat early on.

<h1 style="transform:rotate(-15deg);display:inline-block;">[faq]</h1> "why not exclusively write in beepbox?" it's too dang limiting. no microtones, sampling, etc. BUT i will admit, because of its workflow and limitations there's a very specific (and quite good!) style you can only really get in bbox.

side note - "beepbox" is being used to refer to both beepbox *and* beepbox mods (jummbox etc)

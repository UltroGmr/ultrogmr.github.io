A higher iteration count would result in a 'noisier' image, due to extremely fine details; a fractal from a function as fast-growing as tetration, of course, displays very chaotic behavior. At 100 iterations the spiral pattern is more prominent." title="100-iteration power tower (c^z) fractal centered at -0.188, 0.235. Looks like a spiral made of teardrop shapes.

            <h2>Features:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Input your own custom fractal equations.</p></li>
                <li><p>Render fractal morph videos by using the "t"
                variable in your equation (note: you will have to
                convert the rendered frames to a video yourself via
                FFmpeg or a similar tool).</p></li>
                <li><p>Color images by escape time—for Mandelbrot-like fractals—or by root reached—for Newton fractals.</p></li>
            </ul><br>
